          Currently, I am an undergraduate Marketing student at 
          Florida State University in Tallahassee, FL. I attend Florida State University working 
          on a Bachelor of Science in Marketing with an Accounting minor.  
          My major and minor require in-depth analysis and organizational 
          skills.  I had a study abroad opportunity in International 
          Accounting in Chennai, India.  I have also completed a Digital 
          Marketing Internship over the summer in Tampa. These experiences 
          have allowed me to translate classroom theory into real world 
          applications.	Three-and-a-half-week program exploring globalization and how it is changing
